## Description

Simple web application to practice creation a full stack web application from scratch using Microsoft SQL server for the database, .NET Core Web API for the backend, and Vue JS for the front end. Firstly, I started with creating the necessary tables in the Microsoft SQL server, then created the Web API project with the required rest API endpoints. Finally, I used Vue JS for creating the front end. Also, I added routing for this app. Created bootstrap table with custom sorting and filtering capabilities. Added modal pop-up windows with drop-downs and date pickers. Likewise, I learned how to upload an image and store it in the backend server.
